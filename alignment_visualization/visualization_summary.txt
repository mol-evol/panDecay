Alignment Visualization Summary
===================================

Total alignment sites: 898
Number of clades analyzed: 9
Number of visualization chunks: 1
Layout strategy: combined

Files created:
---------------
• alignment_with_support_<clade>.png - Combined alignment + support visualization per clade
  (Top panel: colored sequence alignment, Bottom panel: site support bars)

Visualization layout:
--------------------
• Top panel: Colored sequence alignment
  - DNA: A=red, T=blue, G=green, C=yellow, gaps=white
• Bottom panel: Site-specific branch support bars
  - Perfectly aligned columns between panels

Support color scheme:
--------------------
• Green bars: Sites supporting the branch (negative ΔlnL)
  (ML tree has better likelihood than constrained tree)
• Red bars: Sites conflicting with the branch (positive ΔlnL)
  (Constrained tree has better likelihood than ML tree)
• Bar height: Proportional to |ΔlnL| magnitude
