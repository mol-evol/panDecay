          Proportion of invariable sites = none
                 Rates at variable sites = equal

Time used to compute likelihoods = 0.02 sec (CPU time = 0.25 sec)

Test(s) for significance of likelihood-score differences:

  Test(s) performed:
    AU: Shimodaira Approximately Unbiased test
  Values for KH/SH/AU tests are P values for null hypothesis of no difference between trees
  Number of bootstrap replicates = 10000
  Starting seed = generated automatically
