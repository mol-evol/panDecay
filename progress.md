# Development Progress - panDecay Project

## Timeline of Major Changes

### July 22-23, 2025: Comprehensive Interface Overhaul

#### Session 1: Initial Investigation and Case Sensitivity
**Commits**: 58f0842, c7d210c
- **Issue**: User experienced perceived "crash" (actually successful completion)
- **Discovery**: Found previous NST-first migration implementation (Phase 1)
- **User Request**: Fix case sensitivity issue with `--data-type DNA`
- **Implementation**: Added case-insensitive argument parsing using custom type functions
- **Result**: All data-type arguments now accept uppercase/lowercase/mixed case

#### Session 2: NST Precedence and Interface Conflicts
**Commit**: e7d855d
- **User Concern**: Believed `--nst 1` wasn't overriding `--model hky`
- **Investigation**: Found NST precedence was actually working correctly
- **Major Discovery**: Interface conflict between `--gamma`, `--invariable`, and `--rates` flags
- **User Decision**: "no need to maintain backward compatibility"  
- **Implementation**: 
  - Removed redundant `--gamma` and `--invariable` flags
  - Enhanced `--rates` to support all 4 combinations (equal, gamma, propinv, invgamma)
  - Updated all model conversion logic

#### Session 3: Deep Architecture Cleanup  
**Commit**: f3ed483
- **User Feedback**: "DEEPTHINK how to fix all of this so it is logical"
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Confusing dual panDecay.py file naming
  - Split argument parsing between root and src
  - Complex model flag system with confusing fallbacks
- **Major Refactor**:
  - Reorganized file structure with clear entry point (`panDecay.py`)
  - Main implementation in `src/main.py`
  - Replaced `--model` with clean data-type-specific flags:
    - `--protein-model` for amino acids
    - `--discrete-model` for morphological characters  
    - `--nst` for DNA (no fallbacks)
  - Set sensible defaults: NST=2, protein=WAG, discrete=Mk
  - Consolidated all argument parsing to single location
  - Removed complex model-to-NST inference logic

#### Session 4: Help Text Clarity
**Commit**: b8e5900
- **User Feedback**: "Mentioning that nst=2 is PAUP's default might mislead a user"
- **Problem**: Help text contained confusing software-specific references
- **Solution**: Comprehensive help text rewrite:
  - Removed all software-specific references (PAUP*, MrBayes)
  - Used clear biological language instead of technical jargon
  - Eliminated confusing "+G", "+I" notation
  - Made all parameter descriptions consistent and user-friendly
