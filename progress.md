# Development Progress - panDecay Project

## Timeline of Major Changes

### July 22-23, 2025: Comprehensive Interface Overhaul

#### Session 1: Initial Investigation and Case Sensitivity
**Commits**: 58f0842, c7d210c
- **Issue**: User experienced perceived "crash" (actually successful completion)
- **Discovery**: Found previous NST-first migration implementation (Phase 1)
- **User Request**: Fix case sensitivity issue with `--data-type DNA`
- **Implementation**: Added case-insensitive argument parsing using custom type functions
- **Result**: All data-type arguments now accept uppercase/lowercase/mixed case

#### Session 2: NST Precedence and Interface Conflicts
**Commit**: e7d855d
- **User Concern**: Believed `--nst 1` wasn't overriding `--model hky`
- **Investigation**: Found NST precedence was actually working correctly
- **Major Discovery**: Interface conflict between `--gamma`, `--invariable`, and `--rates` flags
- **User Decision**: "no need to maintain backward compatibility"  
- **Implementation**: 
  - Removed redundant `--gamma` and `--invariable` flags
  - Enhanced `--rates` to support all 4 combinations (equal, gamma, propinv, invgamma)
  - Updated all model conversion logic

#### Session 3: Deep Architecture Cleanup  
**Commit**: f3ed483
- **User Feedback**: "DEEPTHINK how to fix all of this so it is logical"
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Confusing dual panDecay.py file naming
  - Split argument parsing between root and src
  - Complex model flag system with confusing fallbacks
- **Major Refactor**:
  - Renamed root `panDecay.py` → `pandecay`
  - Renamed `src/panDecay.py` → `src/pandecay_main.py`
  - Replaced `--model` with clean data-type-specific flags:
    - `--protein-model` for amino acids
    - `--discrete-model` for morphological characters  
    - `--nst` for DNA (no fallbacks)
  - Set sensible defaults: NST=2, protein=WAG, discrete=Mk
  - Consolidated all argument parsing to single location
  - Removed complex model-to-NST inference logic

#### Session 4: Help Text Clarity
**Commit**: b8e5900
- **User Feedback**: "Mentioning that nst=2 is PAUP's default might mislead a user"
- **Problem**: Help text contained confusing software-specific references
- **Solution**: Comprehensive help text rewrite:
  - Removed all software-specific references (PAUP*, MrBayes)
  - Used clear biological language instead of technical jargon
  - Eliminated confusing "+G", "+I" notation
  - Made all parameter descriptions consistent and user-friendly

### July 24-26, 2025: Complete Architectural Refactoring - v2.0

#### Session 5: Comprehensive Code Assessment and Planning
**Request**: Complete code overview and assessment focusing on code duplication, bad practices, and poor implementation
- **Discovery**: Monolithic `panDecayIndices` class with 6,293 lines and 111 methods
- **Issues Identified**:
  - 57 hard-coded magic numbers throughout codebase
  - Extensive code duplication across analysis types
  - Poor resource management (no context managers)
  - Complex conditional logic and nested methods
  - Inadequate error handling and recovery
- **User Decision**: "go ahead and make all the changes as suggested. then carry out the testing phase. Do not ask for my approval, do it all."

#### Session 6: Modular Architecture Implementation
**Major Decomposition**: Replaced monolithic class with specialized components
- **Analysis Engines**: Created focused engines for ML, Bayesian, and Parsimony analyses
  - `base_engine.py`: Abstract base class with common interface
  - `ml_engine.py`: PAUP* integration with AU testing
  - `bayesian_engine.py`: MrBayes integration with marginal likelihood
  - `parsimony_engine.py`: Traditional Bremer support calculation
- **Orchestration System**: `AnalysisOrchestrator` coordinates multiple analysis types
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized constants and validation
- **Resource Management**: Context managers for proper cleanup
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Comprehensive error handling with context

#### Session 7: Import System Crisis and Resolution
**Critical Issue**: Import complexities preventing modular architecture usage
- **Problem**: Relative imports failing when modules run as top-level packages
- **Root Cause**: "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" errors
- **User Request**: "i need the import complexities sorted out. Why are there complications? Plan on making a robust solution with no complications."
- **Solution**: Complete migration to absolute imports
  - Updated 86+ import statements across 27 files
  - Eliminated all relative imports and dual-import fallback logic
  - Created `src/__init__.py` for proper package structure
  - Implemented robust absolute import system with `src.` prefix

#### Session 8: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
**8-Phase Test Suite**: Systematic validation of entire refactored system
- **Phase 1**: Import system verification across all modules
- **Phase 2**: Core functionality testing (FileTracker, ProgressLogger, ExternalToolManager)
- **Phase 3**: Individual analysis engine testing and validation
- **Phase 4**: Orchestration system integration testing
- **Phase 5**: End-to-end analysis workflow with example data
- **Phase 6**: Error handling and edge case validation
- **Phase 7**: Configuration and argument parsing verification
- **Phase 8**: Output file organization and directory structure testing
- **Result**: All phases passed - modular architecture fully functional
