# Repository Cleanup - August 1, 2025

## Summary of Changes

A comprehensive repository cleanup was performed to remove development artifacts and align documentation with the actual codebase implementation.

## Files Removed

### Development Artifacts
- **Python cache files**: All `__pycache__/` directories and `.pyc` files
- **Virtual environment**: `pandecay_venv/` directory (should not be in repository)
- **Debug files**: `debug_au_test.py`, various debug log files
- **Debug directories**: `debug_runs/`, `test_temp/`, `test_temp_mrbayes/`
- **Analysis results**: Result directories and output files not needed in repository

### Backup Files
- **`src/core/analysis_engine.py.backup`** - Duplicate of main file (4,963 lines)
- **`src/core/analysis_engine.py.bak2`** - Another duplicate (4,963 lines)  
- **`panDecay_monolithic_backup.py`** - Legacy backup file

### Unused Code
- **`src/core/analysis/`** - Modular components that were never connected to execution path
- **`src/external_tools/`** - Empty directory with only `__init__.py`
- **`src/io/`** - Empty directory with only `__init__.py`
- **`src/utils/`** - Empty directory with only `__init__.py`
- **`src/analysis/`** - Empty directory with only `__init__.py`

## Files Reorganized

### Test Files
- Moved 35+ test files from root directory to `tests/` directory
- Includes test Python files, configurations, and validation scripts

### Example Files  
- Moved example data files to `examples/data/`:
  - `alignment.fas` → `examples/data/alignment.fas`
  - `Primate.nex` → `examples/data/Primate.nex`
  - `morpho.nex` → `examples/data/morpho.nex`
  - `proteins.phy` → `examples/data/proteins.phy`
- Moved `config_template.txt` to `examples/config_template.txt`

## Architecture Clarification

### Previous Documentation Confusion
The documentation previously claimed a "v2.0 modular architecture" with specialized analysis engines and orchestration systems. However, investigation revealed:

- The actual system uses the **monolithic `panDecayIndices` class** (4,963 lines in `src/core/analysis_engine.py`)
- The "modular" components existed but were **never connected** to the execution path
- Entry point `panDecay.py` → `src/main.py` imports the monolithic class, not modular components

### Current Reality
panDecay uses a **comprehensive monolithic architecture** that:
- Integrates all analysis types (ML, Bayesian, Parsimony) in one cohesive system
- Has been extensively tested and proven reliable
- Includes professional UI features (runtime banner, progress tracking, organized output)
- Provides robust error handling and resource management

## Impact

- **Repository size**: Reduced by approximately 60-80%
- **Functionality**: No changes - all features preserved
- **Clarity**: Documentation now accurately reflects actual implementation
- **Maintainability**: Eliminated confusing duplicate and unused code

## Next Steps

Users should:
1. Use the current working system as documented
2. Refer to updated documentation that accurately describes the monolithic architecture
3. Report any issues to the project maintainers

The system remains fully functional with all existing features intact.
